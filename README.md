2. Project Overview
--------------------
## Project Overview

The Mealapp is a mobile app created as part of an assignment given in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio.
The purpose of this will be to provide an ease of information based of what they want to eat for the time of day by simply adding in the time e.g "Morning etc" in and receiving an output as a meal provided by the app for the user.

When creating the app, the app was designed to meet the requirements based of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and cmd automation using GitHub Actions to build my code on github and it built successfully.

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to allow the user to simply acces the app since they are struggling to decide on what to eat.
They simply just insert the time of day and a meal will pop up for them giving them quick and easy results without thinking to much about what they would like to eat. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: Display's the meal based of the time inserted by the user.
- Feature 2: Display's each meal from morning all the way to dinner and dessert for those who wants dessert too.
- Feature 3: Ease of access to all the meals the app will provide to the user and the ease of movement between the apps pages aswell as resetting app funtionalities and exiting the app with no issues.

With these features of the app intergrated, it provides ease of use to the user which allows the simplicity of operating the app.
```

```
4. Design Considerations
------------------------

## Design Considerations

The design of the Meal app was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User experience** The whole design around the app is to brighten up the user's day with having a bright background with pink hue's to the app which provides an asthetic design and entises females to also engage with the app.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility and work as fast as it can.
   
3. **Simplicity/workability**: The design of the app is very minimalistic. It allows the user to get straight to the point feedback on what they want to eat for the day without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage with ease and comfort to the user.
```

```
5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using GitHub for version control.This is where all the code changes are committed and pushed regularly. This allows me to keep track with the constant changes i've made to my code.

### GitHub Actions:
I used GitHub Actions to automate building and deployment, which includes:

- Running and ensuring the tests ran smoothly to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into a APK file, which are the formats required for distribution.
- The upload of these build artifacts to GitHub for ease of access for marking.

The workflow builds, tests, and delivers the APK files automatically whenever I make changes to my code.
```

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges, which included:

1. **Challenge 1**: I wanted to have a specific screen that would allow the user to input their name and age that would take them to the second page where they would be allowed to insert the time of day. 
   - **Solution**: I haven't came up with a solustion to adding that screen due to my files having an issue with incorporating that feature to my app, but in future time i will come up with a solution to add more of a user safe/friendly experience.
   - **Future refrence**:I'd want to do more research on how to incorporate that screen to work without having my files get corrupted.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: The challange I had was the wrong meal type output was being displayed for the time that was inserted by me when testing the app. 
   - **Solution**: I simply swapped around "morning" with "mid-morning" and "mid-lunch" with "lunch" to allow the app to function correctly without interference with the meals.
   - **Future refrence**: Always put the functionality you'd least think should be in the correct location on the code and put that first. Run the code and ensure that it wokrs correctly and if it doesn't then do research on how to make it work.

From the issues faced, I learned that by trial and error the app will run by simply just swapping around certain steps and possibly adding to the code. The constant failing teaches you to keep on trying until you finally understand the issue and hopefully fix the issue. 
```

```
8. Future Enhancements
----------------------
## Future Enhancements

In this version (V1) of the app that provides a simple and effective approach which will come with more features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: "I'd like the app to showcase multiple meal options from that time meal e.g("Morning") that the user can choose from once the specific time of day is inserted into the app."
2. **Feature 2**: "Once the user inserts the time of day, I would like the app to provide a song suggestion for that time of the day inserted that provides the user with an encouraging feeling for the day."
3. **Feature 3**: "The app must display the amount of calories from that meal that is provided from the time input which will be benefical to those users who'd want to know how many calories are being consumed."
4. **Feature 4**: "I'd like the app to provide a resturant that the user can go to have the meal displayed at, depending on the time which was inserted by the user."

With these features i'd like to bring to the app, it will improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for future users.
